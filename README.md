MF-analyzer
===========

This is MF-analyzer software, INRIA branch. It does multiscale/multifractal signal analysis -- the microcanonical way -- at multiple dimensions. Extra: a signal reconstruction algorithm that is at the core of UPM method.

The original MF-analyzer code is publicly available at A. Turiel's site http://www.icm.csic.es/oce/en/content/turiel/MF-analyzer
This should not be taken as a fork but just as a more appropriate space to commit updates and eventually make the code evolve. I am naming it INRIA branch as I include some adaptations I have done to the original code from 2009--2012. It originally started as a means to reproduce the results reported in a research article:

O. Pont, A. Turiel, and C.J. Perez-Vicente
Empirical evidences of a common multifractal signature in economic, biological and physical systems
Physica A , 388, 2025-2035 (2009). DOI: 10.1016/j.physa.2009.01.041 (2007) 

but due to its popularity it now has expanded to a wider goal, which includes evolution.

The original license applies: you are free to use the code in any way, as long as you give appropriate credit to the authors and cite the article. You are free to use the code to process your desired data for your research, as long as you cite the article when you publish the results.
Addendum: the article links to Turiel's page, but if you use this branch you should also add a link to this page.

Because of the evolution of the project, drifting from its original intention, this particular license may evolve in the future to a more standard one. In any case, please contact the authors if you have any request in that sense.

More generally, for any other doubt or suggestion regarding the project please feel free to contact the authors.
